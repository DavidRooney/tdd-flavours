# TDD Flavours

The goal of this repository is to be a treasure trove of insight into various kinds of flavours of TDD. We all know of Kent Becks amasing book __Test Driven Development by example__ and how it changed how we right software. 

In the modern era of software development we have a lot more coders, with many learning from mentors, videos, or articles. We have new variations alongside old ones, and experts just out of reach that make it sound so easy. Yet we still struggle with it.

So here I hope to have a master resource that can be used to help us all. A collection of coding kata's with a git history to really see the process taken by the people we admire in our field. 

My dream for this repository is for anyone to be able to dive into a kata and compare their own approach with those recognised names we often see at conferences and on twitter. 

Here, we can all learn the various flavours of TDD and make our go to coding tool.

## How to use this repository
### Code Kata's
Each folder is a coding kata. Within each one is a collection of folders with names (hopefully some you recognise) who has performed the kata. Use the history of those folders to learn about how their process worked and view the final solution as a way to learn.

### Adding you solution

## My personal attempts at kata's
I've begin this repository with the Oche kata. My process and solution may end up being an example how not to do it. Which I'm perfectly ok with. This is all about learning and helping future TDD evangelists.
